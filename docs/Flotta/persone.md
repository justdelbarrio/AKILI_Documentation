# People

This section allows you to effectively manage individuals associated with your fleet operations. With the capability to add new persons and their relevant characteristics, you can maintain accurate records and streamline your personnel management processes.

Adding a new person is quick and easy. Simply enter their details, including a short name for quick identification, their full name, surname, gender, date of birth, and a worker code unique to each individual. These characteristics allow you to create comprehensive profiles for each person associated with your fleet.

By having this information readily available, you can efficiently manage personnel-related tasks, such as assigning drivers to vehicles, tracking driver performance, and ensuring compliance with regulations. The worker code serves as a unique identifier, making it easy to retrieve and manage personnel information.

With our Person section, you can have a centralized database of all individuals involved in your fleet operations, whether they are drivers, technicians, or other personnel. This simplifies the process of managing their information, making it easier to allocate resources, track certifications and training, and ensure effective communication within your organization.
