# Vehicles

Let's explore the three key parts for inserting a vehicle:

1. Connection:
In this part, you establish the connection between the vehicle and the driver. You can associate a driver with the vehicle by entering their details, including the driver's name, entity, and current state. This helps maintain accurate records and simplifies driver-vehicle assignments.

2. Vehicle Data:
Here, you input specific information about the vehicle itself. This includes the brand, model, year, license plate, environmental class, power output, and traction type. These details provide a comprehensive overview of the vehicle's specifications, aiding in fleet management decision-making.

3. Consumes and Emissions:
In this part, you can enter data related to the vehicle's consumption and emissions. Specify the fuel tank capacity, battery capacity (if applicable), type of fuel/energy used, and battery consumption. These details enable you to track and monitor the vehicle's fuel/energy consumption and emissions, promoting eco-friendly practices and cost optimization.
