# B.I.

The Business Intelligence (B.I.) section of the fleet management program is a powerful tool that streamlines company operations by **simplifying** contract management, tracking vehicle information, handling offers, and automating invoicing. It goes beyond these functions by **collecting essential data** related to invoices, emissions, and kilometers. The B.I. section enables **efficient management and analysis** of invoicing data, providing insights into revenue streams, payment trends, and outstanding balances. Additionally, it **tracks emissions data**, helping companies monitor their environmental impact and make informed decisions to **reduce carbon footprint**. The B.I. section also captures kilometers data, **facilitating accurate mileage reporting**, optimizing routes, and identifying **potential cost-saving opportunities**.
