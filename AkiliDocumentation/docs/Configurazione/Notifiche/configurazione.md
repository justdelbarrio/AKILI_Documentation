# Configuration

This feature enables you to **add and manage elements** characterized by a tag and a JSON configuration.

With the Configuration section, you can easily tailor the behavior and settings of different components within the platform. By utilizing **JSON configuration**, you have a **flexible and powerful tool** to define and adjust parameters, rules, and options according to your specific requirements.

Adding a new element is a **straightforward process**. Simply **provide a descriptive tag** that identifies the element. The tag helps you **organize and categorize** different configurations for easy reference and management. Then, input the JSON configuration that contains the specific parameters and settings for the element.

The JSON configuration allows you to **customize** various aspects of the platform, such as module behavior, UI elements, workflows, and integrations. You can define rules, specify default values, enable or disable features, and much more, all through the structured format of JSON.
