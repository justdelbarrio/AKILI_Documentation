# Roles


Adding a new role is a **straightforward process**. You can assign a unique ID to the role, ensuring easy identification and reference within the system. The tag field enables you to provide a **descriptive name** for the role, helping you categorize and differentiate it from others.

The **authorization level** is one of the most important aspect of role management. It determines the level of access and permissions granted to users assigned to that role. You can define the authorization level based on specific requirements and responsibilities, allowing for **fine-grained control** over the platform's functionalities and resources.

Additionally, the authorization level permit feature provides even more flexibility. It allows you to specify the **particular permissions and actions** that users with the role are **permitted to perform**. This ensures that users have appropriate access **rights and restrictions**, maintaining the security and integrity of the system.

The Roles section goes beyond role creation. It provides **comprehensive management capabilities**, allowing you to modify existing roles, update authorization levels, or adjust authorization level permits as needed. This enables you to adapt user roles to changing business needs and ensure the right level of access for every user.
