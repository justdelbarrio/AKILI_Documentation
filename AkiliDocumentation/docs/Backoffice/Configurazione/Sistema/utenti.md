# Users

Adding a new user is a seamless process. Simply enter a **unique username** for the user (usually is **name.surname**), which serves as their identifier within the system. The tag field allows you to input the user's name and surname, providing a personalized touch to their account. Additionally, you can specify their **email address**, enabling smooth communication and notifications.

The User section goes beyond user creation. It empowers you to **manage user profiles effectively**. You can modify user details, including their username, tag, or email address, as needed. This flexibility allows for accurate and **up-to-date user information**.

In addition to account management, using the Roles section, you can distinguish users with features such as access **control and permissions**. You can assign specific roles and privileges to each user, granting them **appropriate levels of access** to various functionalities and resources within the platform. This ensures a secure and tailored experience for every user.

Furthermore, the User section provides tools to enable user **activation, deactivation, or deletion**. This allows you to manage user accounts based on changing circumstances, maintaining optimal security and data privacy.
